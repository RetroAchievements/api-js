/**
 * A call to this function will retrieve metadata about
 * how a particular user has performed/ranked on a particular
 * game, targeted by game ID.
 *
 * @param authorization An object containing your userName and webApiKey.
 * This can be constructed with `buildAuthorization()`.
 *
 * @param payload.gameId The unique game ID. If you are unsure, open the
 * game's page on the RetroAchievements.org website. For example, Dragster's
 * URL is https://retroachievements.org/game/14402. We can see from the
 * URL that the game ID is "14402".
 *
 * @param payload.userName The user for which to retrieve the
 * game ranking metadata for.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * const userGameRankAndScore = await getUserGameRankAndScore(
 *   authorization,
 *   { gameId: 14402, userName: "xelnia" }
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @returns An array containing metadata about the user's
 * rank and score for the target game ID. If metadata
 * cannot be found, the array is empty.
 * ```json
 * [
 *   {
 *     user: "xelnia",
 *     totalScore: 378,
 *     lastAward: "2022-09-01 21:51:23",
 *     userRank: 3
