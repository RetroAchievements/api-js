/**
 * A call to this function will retrieve the list of

 *
 * @param authorization An object containing your userName and webApiKey.
 * This can be constructed with `buildAuthorization()`.
 *
 * @param payload.gameId The unique game ID. If you are unsure, open the
 * game's page on the RetroAchievements.org website. For example, Dragster's
 * URL is https://retroachievements.org/game/14402. We can see from the
 * URL that the game ID is "14402".
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * const achievementCount = await getAchievementCount(
 *   authorization,
 *   { gameId: 14402 }
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @returns An object containing a gameId and a list of
 * achievementIds.
 * ```
 * { gameId: 14402, achievementIds: [1,2,3,4,5] }
