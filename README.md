## How to begin making API calls

To use any endpoint function in the API, you must first be authorized by RetroAchievements. Fortunately, this is a fairly straightforward process.

1. Visit [your control panel](https://retroachievements.org/controlpanel.php) on the RA website.

2. Find the "Keys" section on the page. Copy the web API key value. **Do not expose your API key anywhere publicly.**

3. You can now create your authorization object using your web API key.

```ts
import { buildAuthorization } from "@retroachievements/api";

const username = "<your username on RA>";
const webApiKey = "<your web API key>";

const authorization = buildAuthorization({ username, webApiKey });
```

4. You now have all you need to use any function in the API. Each function takes this authorization object as its first argument. Here's an example:

```ts
import { getGame } from "@retroachievements/api";

// This returns basic metadata about the game on this page:
// https://retroachievements.org/game/14402
const game = await getGame(authorization, { gameId: 14402 });
```
